 * Cross-screen signal: ChatViewModel sets it when the user sends a message;

 * Held in memory as a Hilt singleton. Not persisted across process death,
 * which is acceptable since the typical flow (send -> back) never kills the process.
 * Chosen over SavedStateHandle because Hilt's injected SavedStateHandle and the
 * NavBackStackEntry.savedStateHandle turned out to be distinct instances, breaking
 * cross-component communication via SavedStateHandle.
